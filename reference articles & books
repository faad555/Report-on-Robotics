This journal article “Robots Make Computer Science Personal” by Douglas Blank is available in UL library.
I found it useful for the project.

Fagin, B., & Laurence, M. (2003). Measuring the effectiveness of robots in teaching computer science.
(this jornal report the aftereffects of a year-long test in the utilization of robots to show software engineering.
The report informational data looks at results from more than 800 students
on indistinguishable tests from both apply autonomy and non-mechanical autonomy based research facility meetings).

(This article discuses the lab work for learning shortcoming recognition and determination (FDD) in mechatronic frameworks.
it also discuss the project where students are requested to develop a discrete event dynamic system (DEDS)
diagnosis to cope with two faulty conditions in an autonomous mobile robot task).
