Impacts of Robotics in Computer Science

Computer Science, as a discipline, started in 1905. Within the first twenty years,
the discipline developed its internal areas, including programming, computational theories,
programming languages design, and operating systems among others (Hopcroft, 1986).
Throughout the years, computer science has blossomed and now extends its reach to graphics, simulation, robotics,
and electronic prototyping. The introduction of Artificial intelligence and machine learning, which are all consequences 
of rapid technological advancements in the 21st century, have positioned computer science as a discipline 
that is going to play critical roles in numerous application areas. Computer Science and Robotics have
consequently emerged as two independent and intertwined disciplines. Computer Science has played a significant role in the 
development of robots and robotics (Fagin & Laurence, 2003). By definition, robotics is engineering and a science branch 
that is concerned with the design, development and application of robots. Physical robots contain some elements of
artificial intelligence and programmable software- an aspect that is supported by computer science.  

The application of robotics has, and continues to impact on computer science in a significant way.
Research and practical use of robotics in computer science, primarily focused on instrumentation, robot design, sensors,
and control theory, have a substantial impact on computer science and its applications. Mobile robots are used to teach 
introductory courses in computer science. They eliminate C|S inherent difficulties thus helping to
make CS a ‘personal’ discipline, and extending its applications to areas and conditions unfavorable for human beings.
Additionally, continued development of robotics will require that CS curriculum be changed to feature in Robotics as a branch of CS.
